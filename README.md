# My-Portfolio
A repository to showcase my personal portfolio of web development and other programming projects.

## Description
This project consists of an html.index file and a styles.css file that create a personal portfolio web page. All of the code was written by me, which was an exciting and challenging opportunity to practice my skills at web development. Using the acceptance criteria as a guide, I started with a sketched wireframe of the layout I intended to build. This was a new process for me and I think it helped me organize my workflow and time management. I tried to push myself to use some CSS techniques that I was previously unfamiliar with, and I am quite happy with the results. I am even more motivated to learn more about CSS styles after working on this project. I plan to continue to make changes that introduce even more advanced style techniques to this portfolio web page in the future. 

## Installation

## Credits
All code within this project was written by me. Some of the advanced CSS style techniques required me to research the exact syntax- for this, I mostly used W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com).
